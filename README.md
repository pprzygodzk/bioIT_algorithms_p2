# bioIT_internship

These are some scripts which work only on prokaryotic (bacterial) DNA & mostly search some kind of specific regions inside it. Only three of them were written when I did an intership at the University of Gda≈Ñsk (here I am talking about: minigenes, palindrome & promoter). The rest of them I wrote when I was just bored at home & wanted to fill up my free time.

Please, do not copy.
